# Explanation of the Trend Recognition Algorithm

The `Trend Recognition Algorithm` is designed to validate and process financial data, ensuring that it meets necessary criteria before analysis. It cleans and organizes the data, addressing any issues such as missing or incomplete information. Once the data is validated, the algorithm analyzes it to identify and separate each trend, classifying the data into distinct Bullish or Bearish trends. This prepares the data for more detailed analysis or further use in financial decision-making.

## 1. Data Input Validation

- **Objective**: Ensure that the input data is of the correct type.
- **Process**:
  - The function checks if the input is a dictionary or a Pandas DataFrame.
  - If the input is a dictionary, it is converted into a DataFrame.
  - If the input is not a DataFrame, the function raises an error.

## 2. Required Columns Verification

- **Objective**: Confirm that the DataFrame contains all necessary columns for analysis.
- **Process**:
  - The function checks for the presence of essential columns: `datetime`, `high`, `open`, `close`, and `low`.
  - If any of these columns are missing, an error is raised to prevent further processing.

## 3. Managing Missing Data

- **Objective**: Handle missing data within the DataFrame to maintain analysis accuracy.
- **Process**:
  - The function calculates the proportion of rows with missing data.
  - If the proportion exceeds a specified threshold (20%), a warning is printed.
  - Rows with missing data are removed to ensure the DataFrame is clean and reliable for trend analysis.

## 4. Trend Classification

- **Objective**: Classify each candle in the DataFrame as either Bullish or Bearish.
- **Process**:
  - For each row in the DataFrame, the function compares the `open` and `close` prices.
  - If the `close` price is higher than the `open`, the candle is classified as Bullish.
  - Conversely, if the `close` price is lower, the candle is classified as Bearish.

## 5. Final Data Preparation

- **Objective**: Ensure the DataFrame is ready for further analysis or use.
- **Process**:
  - After processing, the DataFrame is cleaned and indexed correctly.
  - The function ensures that the DataFrame contains only relevant data, with trends identified and classified for each candle.
