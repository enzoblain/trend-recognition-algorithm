# Trend Recognition Algorithm
This project is a Python-based trend recognition algorithm designed to analyze datasets and identify significant patterns. Using advanced data analysis techniques, the algorithm helps in detecting emerging trends that can be applied in finance.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: The main entry point of the trend recognition algorithm. This script coordinates the different components to identify and analyze trends in the input data.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the necessary Python packages required to run the algorithm.

## Features
- **Trend Detection**: Leverages pattern recognition techniques to identify emerging trends within the data.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes complex data structures to reveal underlying patterns and insights.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable for various data types and applications.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enzoblain/trend-recognition-algorithm.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd trend-recognition-algorithm
```
3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the trend recognition algorithm, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

You can adjust input parameters and settings directly in `main.py` to suit your data and analysis needs.
